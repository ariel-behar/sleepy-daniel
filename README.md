This is the the first website I ever did. Not much to brag about technically, but it does hold a sentimental value to me since these were the days I was making my first baby steps into the HTML/CSS skills world and I wanted to put them in action. My nephew had just been born, and this seemed like a no-brainer to who or what my first project would be devoted to.
