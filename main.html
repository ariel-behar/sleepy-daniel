                    <h1>Meet Daniel...</h1>
                    <p>Daniel Zalmen Jackson (a.k.a Misho, Mishoka) was born to a middle class family in Clearwater, Florida-USA. Having spent most of his existence in the womb of his mother, he decided from an early age to dedicate his life to the exploration of the world around him. Fascinated by the colors and lights he was gradually beginning to recognize during his first few weeks of his unconscious presence on this planet, Daniel began to stare in amazement at the extraordinary shapes of walls, chandeliers, ceilings, and pillows surrounding him. </p><p>A t a very early age he taught himself the proper use of diapers, pacifiers, and proper application of his vocal cords to achieve his goals in life. Having accumulated experience of more than two weeks, Daniel learned that the universe would realign itself to suit his needs as long as his voice is  heard echoing around him. As expected as it would seem to be an abuse of such inmense power, Daniels's attitude can only be characterized with an enormous expression of mercy and compassion towards his servants. Obviously, this being true for regular business hours not including the 2-3 times a night when he's in an urgent need for a snack... </p>

His calm approach helps Daniel reach heights of comfort   that can only be described as "fit for royalty".</p>
