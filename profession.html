If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody</b><span style="font-size: 150%; color: #8A2BE2; font-family: two;text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;">"</span></cite> (Longfellow, Henry W). Having heard these words of wisdom, Daniel's approach to life had transformed at once. His ability to keep up with daily tasks had suddenly found a new source of fuel for his motivation. The afternoon nap did not seem like a hassle anymore and neither did the 10 to 12 times a day he would have to eat. Having such power at his disposal, Daniel decided to focus his energy on more important things such as developing the tonality of his cry for attention. Little by little, the pitch was perfected into a balanced degree between "I need something" and "I'm still very cute, aren't I?". Indeed, perseverance proved itself to be the key component of his success. Not only did his skills improve greatly in a relatively short amount of time, but additional vocal twists were added every other week. Having figured out his lifelong ambitions already at an early age, Daniel saw nothing wrong with getting some rest here and there in between... well... naps.  </p>
